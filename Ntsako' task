Risks:
- Technical glitches in the app could undermine trust and discourage usage.
- Inaccurate AI predictions could lead to poor crop management decisions.
- Over-reliance on technology might deter farmers from traditional knowledge.

Tools and Techniques:
- AI and machine learning algorithms for data analysis, including neural networks for image recognition and natural language processing for personalized advice.
- Mobile app development frameworks for cross-platform accessibility.
- Internet-of-Things sensors for real-time data collection on weather conditions and soil moisture.

By combining these tools and techniques, AgriPal aims to create a holistic solution that empowers farmers with actionable insights, 
fosters informed decision-making and ultimately contributes to the growth and well-being of rural communities.
